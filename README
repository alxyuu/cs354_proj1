 * Put the results of the Performance Test here.  Also, include the names
 * of your team members and any special instructions for compiling, etc.,
 * if you did something besides the standard Makefile.

 * Performance Tests:
 * |-----------------------|
 * |  Mode  | Time Elapsed |
 * |--------|--------------|
 * | 1      | 17.99s       |
 * | 1 wire | 18.00s       |
 * | 2      | 18.00s       |
 * | 3      | 17.99s       |
 * | 4      | 17.99s       |
 * | 4 wire | 17.99s       |
 * | 5      | 17.99s       |
 * | 6      | 17.99s       |
 * | 7      | 17.99s       |
 * |-----------------------|
 *
 * All three cone display modes ran at approximately the same time. We expected 
 * the calculated cone display to take the longest, but due to the high performance
 * of the cpu and gpu, the differences in real world performance between the three
 * modes were negligible.
 *
 * Extra Credit:
 * In our freeform scene, we implemented transparency, dynamically calculated cylinders,
 * and the ability to resize the inner and outer cubes using the hotkeys 1, 3, 7, and 9.
